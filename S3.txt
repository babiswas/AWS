2.S3 
3.EFS(Elastic File System)
4.Glacier
5.Storage Gateway
6.Snowball

S3(Simple Storage Service)
Maximum size of the file is 5TB
11 9 durability
High Availibility.

Security:
1.Bucket Policy
2.Encryption

S3 is a regional service no restricted to one AVZ
1.Frequently Accessed
2.Infrequent Data Access
3.Glacier


Object consists of key and metadata.
A bucket store objects
Scope of S3 is region.

5TB is the maximum limit of the file in S3 bucket.

We need to choose region while creating a bucket.

Bucket Policy
Encryption

Object Transition
Object lifecycle

S3 standard(Frequently access data)
Infrequent Access(Less Frequently access data)
Archieved(Glacier)
S3 RRS(Reduced REdundancy Storage)(Non Critical)

OneZone 1A storage class
Lifecycle Management.
Moving the data from one storage tier to another storage tier.
Transition actions

Transition,Expiration



Bucket Policy:(I AM policy)
