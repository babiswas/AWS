SQS(Simple Queue Service)
1.Reliable.
2.Scalable.
3.Fully managed service.
Type of queue in SQS
1.Standard Queue.
2.FIFO Queue.
>SQS deletes messages that is in the queue more than retention period.
>The Retention period can be configured.
>Decoupling.

Standard queue:
--------------
>Standard Queue is a default type of queue.(Default queue).
>Unlimited no of transaction per second.(Unlimited Transaction).
>Support at least once message delivery.(At least once delivery).
>Standard queue provide best effort ordering.(Best effort ordering).
Uploading Media.
Credit card validation request.
Batch messages for future processing.


FIFO Queue:
-----------
1.All the capabilities of standard queue.
2.FIFO queue is useful where duplicates cannot be tolerated.
3.Order of operations and events are critical.
4.FIFO queue support 3000 messages per second with batching
5.FIFO queue support 300 messages per action.


AWS SQS Architecture:
--------------------
1.Standard Queue
2.FIFO queue.

Three parts of the mesage queue service
1.Components
2.Queue
3.Message


SQS message lifecycle:
---------------------
Visibility timeout period.
Within the VT the message should be processed and deleted.
ComponentA and ComponentB competes for a message ,after one recieves it ,the other has to wait for the visibility timeout.

*Visibility Timeout(standard queue)

Standard Queue(Create)
---------------------
Default queue type is always standard.
Queuename.FIFO for FIFO queue queue.
Standard queue is supported in all regions.
Deletion of the queue takes 60 seconds.
A standard queue cannot be converted into FIFO queue.
ABC.FIFO  this is a FIFO queue.


Requirement and Attribute:
---------------------------
1.Visibility Time out.
2.Retention Period.
3.MaximumMessageSize.
4.Delivery delay.#After how much time the message becomes visible to the queue after it is visible.
5.Recieve Message Wait time.#How long a process should wait for a message.
6.Redrive policy
7.


Dead Letter Queue Settings:
---------------------------
Server Side encryption settings:
1.Use SSE
2.CMK
3.Data Queue Reuse Period.


Requirement for standard queue:
-------------------------------
Hash is used to figureout duplication.
SHA-256


Deadletter Queue:
----------------
The message that couldn't be processed by a consumer is inserted into dead letter queue.
Every queue has a dead letter queue associated with it.
Better to have a message retention period of more than 7 days.
